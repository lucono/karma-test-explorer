# Karma Test Explorer (for Angular, Jasmine, and Mocha)

This extension adds a rich and fully integrated testing experience to Visual Studio Code for Angular, TypeScript, and JavaScript projects that use [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) for testing.

It shows your Karma tests in a visual explorer in VS Code, adds code lenses and gutter decorations to your test files, and shows test failure details inline within your code at the point of each failure.

The side bar shows rich information about your tests, including focused âš¡ and disabled ðŸ’¤ tests (left image), and details summarizing passed, failed and skipped tests after each test execution (right image).
