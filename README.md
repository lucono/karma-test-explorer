# Karma Test Explorer (for Angular, Jasmine, and Mocha)

This extension runs your Karma or Angular tests in Visual Studio Code using the [Test Explorer UI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-test-explorer), and supports the Jasmine and Mocha test frameworks. It is based on [Angular/Karma Test Explorer](https://github.com/Raagh/angular-karma_test-explorer), with various significant [enhancements](./docs/documentation.md#why-this-extension).
