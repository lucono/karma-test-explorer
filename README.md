## Quick Start

Karma Test Explorer uses reasonable defaults that in many cases means it will work out-of-the-box without any configuration. Nonetheless, specific configuration to the particular needs of your project can often bring additional performance, usability and features that increase the productivity and value of the extension to you and your team.

To quickly get started:

- Ensure the required dependencies are installed - Chrome browser on the computer or container, and the project dependencies (such as Karma, Angular, Jasmine, Mocha, etc)
- Install the Karma Test Explorer [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lucono.karma-test-explorer)
- If the project root path is not same as the VS Code workspace root, specify its path using the `karmaTestExplorer.projectRootPath` setting
- If the `karma.conf.js` file is not at the project root folder, specify its path using the `karmaTestExplorer.karmaConfFilePath` setting
- Specify your project's test files using the `karmaTestExplorer.testFiles` setting
- Apply the updated settings and wait a moment while it refreshes, or simply restart VS Code
- When done, you should see your tests in the Test View, and code lenses above each test in the editor, either of which can be used to run and debug the tests

## Why this Extension

The Karma Test Explorer extension was initially created out of [need for additional features](https://github.com/Raagh/angular-karma_test-explorer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Alucono) from the [Angular/Karma Test Explorer](https://github.com/Raagh/angular-karma_test-explorer) extension at a time when that project seemed not to be accepting contributions anymore, and is a major rewrite aimed at facilitating various significant enhancements and new features (such as some of those in the initial release [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md#010---sep-28-2021)). 

This extension's core focus is on better and robust support for:

- Large projects with thousands of tests
- Remote development sceanarios with [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)
- Flexibility to support a wide range of testing scenarios and workflows
- Reliability, usability, and team productivity
