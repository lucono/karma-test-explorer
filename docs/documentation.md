## Extension Setup

### 1. Install Prerequisites

|Prerequisite | Description|
|:-------------|------------|
|Test&nbsp;Browser | Karma Test Explorer requires a browser for running tests, which by default is the Chrome browser, though you can [customize](#customizing-the-launcher-and-browser) it to use any other browser of your choice. Whichever browser is used however, must be available for testing in your Karma setup and installed on the computer or container where VS Code will be running your project's tests|
|Test&nbsp;Frameworks | The various frameworks required for your project's tests must be installed. This can include for instance, Angular, Karma, Jasmine, Mocha, Karma-Jasmine, Karma-Mocha, etc., all of which will usually be defined as Dev dependencies in your project's package.json file, so that simply running `npm install` (or `yarn install` if using yarn) would ensure they are all installed|
|Karma&nbsp;Test&nbsp;Explorer | The Karma Test Explorer [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lucono.karma-test-explorer) must be installed and enabled in VS Code. If developing and testing your project in a container or remote server, then the extension's installation in VS Code should be in the remote workspace|

### 2. Configure Extension

|Description&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | When&nbsp;Required | Config&nbsp;Setting
|:-------|---------------|----------------
|Specify the path to the project relative to the workspace folder | If the root path of the project is not the same as the VS Code workspace folder root | `karmaTestExplorer.projectWorkspaces`
|Specify the path to the `karma.conf.js` file relative to the project root folder | If the `karma.conf.js` file has a different filename, or is not located in the project root folder | `karmaTestExplorer.karmaConfFilePath`
|Specify project [test files](#specifying-test-files) | Always recommended, for better performance | `karmaTestExplorer.testFiles`
|Ensure you DO NOT have any of these Test Explorer UI settings configured | Required to prevent conflict with Karma Test Explorer functionality | `testExplorer.useNativeTesting` and `testExplorer.onStart` and `testExplorer.onReload`
|Provide any other relevant [settings](#extension-settings) | Optionally, use any other Karma Test Explorer [settings](#extension-settings) that are relevant to your needs to further customize it to the your project and team| See [all settings](#extension-settings)

### 3. Run Your Tests

When done configuring the extension, select the Karma Test Explorer prompt to __Apply Settings__ and wait a moment while it refreshes. You can also simply reload VS Code to apply the changes if you don't see the prompt.

After Karma Test Explorer is done refreshing with the updated settings, your tests should show up in the Test View, as well as code lenses above each test in the code editor, either of which can be used to run and debug the tests.
  
---

Note that Karma Test Explorer will briefly display updates (using available space if any) on the VS Code status bar, showing the current status of test operations. You can click on the status bar message to display additional options or show the extension log.

---

## Extension Activation Rules

The Karma Test Explorer extension is activated for a project workspace or folder based on the presence of ANY one of the following conditions:

- The project workspace has the `karmaTestExplorer.enableExtension` setting set to `true`. This setting is a maunal override of the extension's automatic activation rules to forcefully activate or deactivate the extension
- The project workspace has one or more Karma Test Explorer extension settings (`karmaTestExplorer.*`) configured, except for `karmaTestExplorer.enableExtension` set to `false`
- The project declares a `karma` dev dependency in its `package.json` file

<a href="#contents"><img align="right" height="24" src="img/back-to-top.png"></a>

---

## Project Types

Karma Test Explorer supports both [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/) projects, and is usually able to automatically detect which type your project is based on the presence of certain standard configuration files associated with specific project types. If the right project type is not automatically detected, you can use the `karmaTestExplorer.projectType` setting to explicitly specify a different type for your project.

### Karma Projects
Projects which DO NOT have an `angular.json` or `.angular-cli.json` file in the project root are loaded as plain Karma projects. Use the various [extension options](#extension-settings) where necessary to then customize Karma Test Explorer's behavior to the specific needs of your project and team.

### Angular Projects

Projects with an `angular.json` or `.angular-cli.json` file in the project root are loaded as Angular projects. Note that if no angular config file is found for a project that is explicitly configured as an Angular project using the `karmaTestExplorer.projectType` setting, then the project will be loaded instead as a plain Karma project.

<a href="#contents"><img align="right" height="24" src="img/back-to-top.png"></a>

---

## Test Frameworks

Karma Tesk Explorer supports both the [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test frameworks, and is usually able to automatically detect which one is in use by your project. It is therefore usually not necessary to manually specify the test framework in the Karma Test Explorer settings unless the right framework is not automatically detected, in which case you can use the `karmaTestExplorer.testFramework` config option to specify the right framework.

In the case of the Mocha test framework, the same setting can also be used to specify the Mocha testing interface style (BDD or TDD) that is used by your project.

---
Note that watch mode is currently not supported for the Mocha test framework.

## Extension Settings

Though Karma Test Explorer comes with many configuration options that make it flexible to adapt to a wide range of project setups and testing workflows, you may not need to set any of the options as the defaults are designed to work for most projects out of the box. If required however, customizing some of the options to the specific needs of your project may help you get even more out of it for your project and team.

Setting                                       | Description
-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------
`karmaTestExplorer.enableExtension` | Explicitly enables or disables Karma Test Explorer when its default project inspection to automatically enable or disable itself does not yield the desired decision
`karmaTestExplorer.projectWorkspaces` | Experimental and subject to change in future releases! This is a list, each entry of which is either a string of the relative path (relative to the VS Code workspace root folder) to a project workspace for testing, or an object having a `rootPath` property with the value of that path. The object format also accepts the following optional properties which can be used to provide the corresponding settings specifically for that project workspace - `projectType`, `karmaConfFilePath`, `testFramework`, `testFiles`, `excludeFiles`, `testsBasePath`. Like other Karma Test Explorer settings, when not explicitly configured, most settings will be auto-detected where possible with reasonable values for each project workspace
`karmaTestExplorer.projectType` | The type of the project. This will be auto-detected if not specified. Specify the right project type if not correctly auto-detected
`karmaTestExplorer.testFramework` | The test framework used by the project. This will be auto-detected if not specified. Specify the right test framework if not correctly auto-detected
`karmaTestExplorer.karmaConfFilePath` | The path where the `karma.conf.js` file is located (relative to the project root path)
`karmaTestExplorer.testGrouping` | How tests should be grouped in the Test view side bar
`karmaTestExplorer.flattenSingleChildFolders` | Flattens paths consisting of single child folders when using folder-based test grouping
`karmaTestExplorer.showTestDefinitionTypeIndicators` | Show test definition type indicators such as tests defined as focused or disabled
`karmaTestExplorer.excludeDisabledTests` | Exclude disabled tests from the test view
`karmaTestExplorer.showOnlyFocusedTests` | Show only focused tests in the test view. This is always true if using the Mocha test framework
`karmaTestExplorer.showUnmappedTests` | Include tests in the test view which were returned by Karma but either not discovered or included in the set of test files configured for Karma Test Explorer
`karmaTestExplorer.karmaPort` | The port to be used by default for the Karma server in VS Code. Whenever the port is not available, the next available port is used
`karmaTestExplorer.browser` | The browser that will be launched by Karma for testing. This can also include any valid custom launcher defined in the Karma config file. This takes precedence over the `customLauncher` setting
`karmaTestExplorer.customLauncher` | Specify the karma custom launcher configuration for launching the test browser, similar to a custom launcher entry in a karma config file
`karmaTestExplorer.autoWatchEnabled` | Enables automatic re-run of tests when the files change
`karmaTestExplorer.autoWatchBatchDelay` | The delay in milliseconds when autoWatch is enabled for batching multiple file changes into a single rerun. This is the same as Karma config's `autoWatchBatchDelay` option and overrides it when set
`karmaTestExplorer.nonHeadlessModeEnabled` | Enables non-headless testing so that the browser UI is displayed when running tests. Has no effect when running in a container, or when the default value of the `customLauncher` or `browser` config settings are overridden
`karmaTestExplorer.allowGlobalPackageFallback` | Allows use of global install of Karma or Angular if available and there is no local install in the project folder
`karmaTestExplorer.env` | Additional environment variables to be set when running the tests. These override the values of the same variables if also provided through the `envFile` setting
`karmaTestExplorer.envFile` | Path to a dotenv file containing environment variables to be set when running the tests
`karmaTestExplorer.karmaProcessCommand` | The command or path to an executable to use for launching Karma. This is useful for using a custom script or different command other than the default
`karmaTestExplorer.angularProcessCommand` | The command or path to an executable to use for launching or running Angular tests. This is useful for using a custom script or different command other than the default
`karmaTestExplorer.testTriggerMethod` | Specifies how test runs are triggered by default. You will usually not need to use this setting unless working around specific issues
`karmaTestExplorer.testParsingMethod` | Specifies how tests are parsed by default, either using regular expression matching or an abstract syntax tree. You will usually not need to use this setting unless working around specific issues
`karmaTestExplorer.enabledParserPlugins` | Experimental and subject to change in future releases! Specifies the exact set of Babel parser plugins to enable for parsing test files. Useful for enabling full support for various language syntaxes present in the test files
`karmaTestExplorer.failOnStandardError` | Treats any Karma, Angular, or other testing stderr output as a failure. This can sometimes be useful for uncovering testing issues
`karmaTestExplorer.testsBasePath` | The base folder containing the test files (relative to the project root path for Karma projects, or the project `root` path specified in `angular.json` for Angular workspace projects). If not specified, defaults to the longest common path of the tests discovered in the project
`karmaTestExplorer.testFiles` | The path glob patterns identifying the test files (relative to the project root path)
`karmaTestExplorer.excludeFiles` | The path glob patterns identifying files to be excluded from `testFiles` (relative to the project root path). The `node_modules` folder is always excluded
`karmaTestExplorer.reloadOnKarmaConfigChange` | Enables reloading of Karma on changes to the Karma configuration file
`karmaTestExplorer.reloadOnChangedFiles` | The files which when modified will trigger a Karma reload
`karmaTestExplorer.karmaReadyTimeout` | The duration in milliseconds after which the extension will stop listening and give up if Karma is not started, connected to the extension, and ready for testing
`karmaTestExplorer.defaultSocketConnectionPort` | The port that will be used for connecting Karma with the test explorer. When not specified, Karma Test Explorer will automatically use the first available port equal to, or higher than, 9999
`karmaTestExplorer.debuggerConfigName` | The name of the launch configuration that will be used for debugging tests, which can be the name of any launch configuration defined or available in the VS Code `launch.json` file. This takes precedence over the `debuggerConfig` setting
`karmaTestExplorer.debuggerConfig` | The debugger configuration to be used in debugging the Karma tests in VS Code. This is similar to a VS Code launch configuration entry in the `.vscode/launch.json` file
`karmaTestExplorer.webRoot` | The web root to be used when debugging the Karma tests in VS Code. This takes precedence over the `webRoot` property in the `debuggerConfig` setting and supports using the `${workspaceFolder}` variable for the absolute workspace folder path. This setting is similar to the `webRoot` property of a VS Code launch configuration entry in the `.vscode/launch.json` file
`karmaTestExplorer.pathMapping` | The path mappings to be used when debugging the Karma tests in VS Code. These take precedence over any identical path mappings defined in the `debuggerConfig` setting and support using the `${webRoot}` variable for the configured `webRoot` value, and the `${workspaceFolder}` variable for the absolute path of the workspace folder. This setting is similar to the `pathMapping` property of a VS Code launch configuration entry in the `.vscode/launch.json` file
`karmaTestExplorer.sourceMapPathOverrides` | The source map path overrides to be used when debugging the Karma tests in VS Code. These take precedence over any identical source map path overrides defined in the `debuggerConfig` setting and support using the `${webRoot}` variable for the configured `webRoot` value, and the `${workspaceFolder}` variable for the absolute path of the workspace folder. This setting is similar to the `sourceMapPathOverrides` property of a VS Code launch configuration entry in the `.vscode/launch.json` file
`karmaTestExplorer.containerMode` | Enables additional support for easier testing when running in a container. If not specified, this will be enabled when the project is detected to be running in a container, or disabled otherwise
`karmaTestExplorer.logLevel` | Sets the level of logging detail produced in the output panel of the extension. More detailed levels such as the `debug` level can be helpful when troubleshooting issues with running Karma or the extension
`karmaTestExplorer.karmaLogLevel` | Sets the level of logging detail for the Karma server in its output channel, which can be helpful when troubleshooting issues with running Karma or the extension
`karmaTestExplorer.karmaReporterLogLevel` | Sets the level of logging detail for the Karma Test Explorer reporter which logs additional details to the Karma server log related to the processing of test and browser events in Karma. This can be helpful when troubleshooting issues with how test and browser events are being processed in Karma and exchanged with the Karma Test Explorer. Set this to `disable` in order to not log any additional output from the reporter into the Karma server logs

## Specifying Test Files

By default, Karma Test Explorer searches for test files in every path under the project root directory (excluding `node_modules` directories). However, by explicitly specifying the location of your test files via the `karmaTestExplorer.testFiles` setting, you can reduce the amount of file scanning that's required to find your tests by limiting it to only the folders and files that actually contain the tests, which can significantly speed up discovery of your tests and improve the overall performance of your testing with the Karma Test Explorer.

### Default Test Discovery

The default test discovery behavior looks for tests in all files with the filename pattern `(test|spec)[._-]*` or `*[._-](test|spec)`, and having a `.js` or `.ts` file extension. For example, the following files would all be detected as test files by default, anywhere under the project root directory tree (except for the `node_modules` directory):

- `app.spec.ts`
- `app-test.js`
- `app-spec.ts`
- `app_spec.ts`
- `test.app.js`
- `spec.app.js`
- `test-app.ts`
- `spec_app.js`

### Customizing Test Discovery

You can change the default test discovery behavior by customizing test file detection to the specific name pattern and paths for your test files by using the `karmaTestExplorer.testFiles` extension setting, which accepts an array of file glob patterns that identify the locations of your test files.

For example:

```json
{
  "karmaTestExplorer.testFiles": [
    "src/test/**/test-*.js"
  ]
}
```

<a href="#contents"><img align="right" height="24" src="img/back-to-top.png"></a>

---

## Specifying a Test Framework

By default, when no test framework is specified (ie, the `karmaTestExplorer.testFramework` config option is not set), Karma Test Explorer will try to auto-detect the test framework that is used by your project by looking at its `karma.conf.js` file. If it detects the Mocha framework, it will by default assume the BDD style for the project. If your project uses Mocha with the TDD style instead, or if your project's test framework is not correctly detected for any other reason, you can explicitly specify the right framework by setting the `karmaTestExplorer.testFramework` config option, whicn can have one of the following values:

Value | Description
------|------------
`jasmine` | The Jasmine test framework
`mochaâˆ’bdd` | The Mocha test framework with the BDD-style interface which uses `describe` to define test suites and `it` to define test cases. This is the default assumed when Mocha is auto-detected as the test framework
`mochaâˆ’tdd` | The Mocha test framework with the TDD-style interface which uses `suite` to define test suites and `test` to define test cases

Most times however, you will not need to set this config option at all as Karma Test Explorer will be able to automatically detect the right test framework in use by your project. Note also that specifying a framework value that is different from the one actually in use by your project will usually result in your tests not being successfully discovered.

<a href="#contents"><img align="right" height="24" src="img/back-to-top.png"></a>

---

## Testing Multiple Projects

Karma Test Explorer supports simultaneous multi-project testing for various multi-project setups and scenarios, including:

Multi-Project Setup | Description
-------------|------------
VS Code multi-root workspace | For a multi-root workspace that is open in VS Code, all Karma and Angular projects in each root of the multi-root workspace will be available to load for testing
Multi-project Angular workspace | For each Angular workspace that is configured or automatically discovered by Karma Test Explorer in a VS Code workspace, all its sub-projects will be available to load for testing
Monorepo or Embedded project | For a monorepo with different projects in various sub-folders, or a single project with embedded projects located in paths under the main project folder, the various projects can be configured for simultaneous testing in a single VS Code workspace using the `karmaTestExplorer.projectWorkspaces` extension setting, which allows for specifying the path to each project and optionally also providing some project-specific settings for each project. See the [Extension Settings](#extension-settings) section for more details on how to use this setting

In any scenario, whenever multiple Karma or Angular projects are available for testing, a folder button will be available on the Test view toolbar which can be used for selecting and loading any number of those projects for simultaneous testing in the UI. The folder button is not available when there is only a single project configured or detected for testing in the current VS Code workspace.

### Configuration examples using the `projectWorkspaces` option

Specifying multiple projects using the relative path to each:

```json
"karmaTestExplorer.projectWorkspaces": [
  "path/to/project-1/root",
  "path/to/project-2/root"
]
```

Specifying multiple projects with some additional per-project configuration:

```json
"karmaTestExplorer.projectWorkspaces": [
  {
    "rootPath": "path/to/project-1/root",
    "karmaConfFilePath": "relative/to/rootPath/karma.conf.js",
    "testFiles": ["test/**/*.spec.ts"],
    "excludeFiles": ["test/path/to/exclude"]
  },
  {
    "rootPath": "path/to/project-2/root",
    "testFiles": ["test/**/*.spec.ts"]
  }
]
```

Specifying multiple projects while only providing additional configuration for some, but not all, of the projects:

```json
"karmaTestExplorer.projectWorkspaces": [
  "./path/to/project-1/root",
  "./path/to/project-2/root",
  {
    "rootPath": "path/to/project-3/root",
    "testFiles": ["test/**/*.spec.ts"]
  }
]
```

---

## Non-Headless Testing

Though by default Karma Test Explorer runs tests headlessly (using a headless instance of Chrome), it also has support for non-headless testing which can be enabled with the `karmaTestExplorer.nonHeadlessModeEnabled` setting. When this is enabled, the browser UI will be displayed when Karma Test Explorer is started, and you will be able to see your tests being executed in the browser.

Non-headless testing through the `nonHeadlessModeEnabled` setting is not supported in certain scenarios where non-headless usage would normaly not be possible, such as when running in a container. It is also not supported when the default value of the `customLauncher` or `browser` config settings have been overridden to use a non-Chrome browser, which is the default browser used by Karma Test Explorer. It is however supported in all other cases, including when running on WSLg (Windows Subsystem for Linux GUI) on Windows 11.

Also note that for regular headless testing, Karma Test Explorer supports any browser (Chrome or non-Chrome) with a Karma launcher implementation that is installed in the project, including Firefox, Edge, and others.

---

## Testing in a Development Container

With VS Code's Development Container feature, you can develop and run your project's Karma tests inside a container, using browsers installed in that container. However, launching Chrome and other Chromium browsers in a container environment often requires additional browser flags and other adjustments. Therefore, to fully support DevContainer-based setups and workflows, Karma Test Explorer provides a number of options to help make development and testing smoother and more seamless in those scenarios.

### Use Container Mode

By default, Karma Test Explorer will automatically detect whether you are testing in a container environment, in which case it will activate `containerMode` which makes all necessary customizations required for smoother container-based development and testing. You can also manually enable this mode by setting the `karmaTestExplorer.containerMode` config setting to `enabled`. Because its default value when not set is `auto`, it should mostly not be necessary to manually set this option at all, unless in a situation where you are running in a container environment and find that Karma Test Explorer is not able to automatically detect it.

When in container mode, the adjustments made by Karma Test Explorer include internally applying the `--no-sandbox` flag when launching the default Chrome browser, unless either of the `karmaTestExplorer.browser` or `karmaTestExplorer.customLauncher` config options are also specified, in which case it is up to the user to ensure that the provided browser launcher is properly set up to successfully launch the associated browser in the container environment.

### Other Options for Testing in a Dev Container

If for any reason, using the `karmaTestExplorer.containerMode` setting is not a viable option for your project (for example, if you're using a different browser and need to apply a different set of browser flags, or if the `--no-sandbox` browser flag which is internally added by the `containerMode` option would break or conflict with other functionality or setup in your project's container environment), then you might still be able to leverage Karma Test Explorer's other customization options to successfully achieve a working VS Code test setup for your project within your container environment.

---

## Customizing the Launcher and Browser

### Use the `customLauncher` Option

With the `karmaTestExplorer.customLauncher` config option, you can provide a custom launcher definition directly in your VS Code settings that Karma Test Explorer will use for running your project's Karma tests. This makes it possible to provide a customized launcher for testing your project in VS Code without needing to modify your project's Karma config file to define a new launcher or adapt an existing one for running your project's tests.

For example, in your VS Code project's settings file:

```json
"karmaTestExplorer.customLauncher": {
  "base": "SomeBrowser",
  "flags": [
    "--some-launcher-flag",
    "--another-flag"
  ]
}
```

### Use the `browser` Option

With the `karmaTestExplorer.browser` config option, you can specify the name of any custom launcher definition that would normally be available to Karma for test execution in your project, including any that are defined in the `customLaunchers` property of your project's Karma config file. This makes it possible and easy for testing your project in VS Code to reuse any custom launcher that's already defined in your Karma config file, and that's already properly configured to work in your project's environment.

For example, in your project's `karma.conf.js`:

```js
customLaunchers: {
  MyCustomLauncher: {
    base: 'SomeBrowser',
    flags: [ '--some-launcher-flag' ]
  }
}
```

And in your VS Code project's settings file:

```json
"karmaTestExplorer.browser": "MyCustomLauncher"
```

<a href="#contents"><img align="right" height="24" src="img/back-to-top.png"></a>

---

## Providing Environment Variables

The `karmaTestExplorer.env` and `karmaTestExplorer.envFile` config options can be used to provide any environment variables that are required by your test execution setup (such as for instance, using the `CHROME_PATH` or `CHROME_BIN` environment variable to specify the path to a custom browser process used for running your tests).

Example, in your VS Code project's settings file:

```json
"karmaTestExplorer.env": {
  "ENV_VAR_1": "env_var_1_value",
  "ENV_VAR_2": "env_var_2_value",
  "ENV_VAR_3": "env_var_3_value"
}
```

Or to use variables in an external dot-env file:

```json
"karmaTestExplorer.envFile": "path/to/file.env"
```

<a href="#contents"><img align="right" height="24" src="img/back-to-top.png"></a>

---

## Output Panels

For each project for testing, Karma Test Explorer adds the output channels described below to the Output panel of VS Code. Some or all of these channels can be disabled by setting their corresponding `logLevel` config option to `disable` in cases where this option is available.

Name | Description
-----|-------------
Karma&nbsp;Test&nbsp;Explorer | This output panel shows the logs of the Karma Test Explorer extension. The `karmaTestExplorer.logLevel` setting can be used to set the desired level of extension logging detail, with `trace` having the most detailed and verbose logging.
Karma&nbsp;Server | This output panel shows the Karma server log. The `karmaTestExplorer.karmaLogLevel` setting can be used to specify the desired level of logging detail from the Karma server, while the `karmaTestExplorer.karmaReporterLogLevel` setting can be used to specify the desired level of logging detail from Karma Test Explorer's Karma reporter plugin, whose output also appears in the Karma server log.

<a href="#contents"><img align="right" height="24" src="img/back-to-top.png"></a>

---

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Karma Test Explorer works best with the Test Explorer UI, and may not work properly if the `testExplorer.useNativeTesting` config setting is set to `true` to disable the Test Explorer UI in favor of VS Code's native testing UI
- Watch mode is not yet supported for the Mocha test framework
